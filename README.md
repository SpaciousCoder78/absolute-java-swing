## What is Swing?
Swing is a built-in GUI library that comes with JDK. It's a lightweight and easy to use library. It's also an extension of AWT. Swing supports a lot of features and its the ideal library for building simple and interactive desktop GUI apps. JavaFX is the successor of Swing but it has a learning curve and is mostly used for web applications whereas Swing can be used for small-scale GUI applications .

## How to use Swing?

Since Swing is a built-in library, we can directly import it from our java file without the need of Gradle or Maven. 

It can be imported using ```import javax.swing.*``` 

Once you add that line of code to your java file, you can start using Swing's elements in your Java code.
